**12bit.vn** was created in the early of 2018 with the goal is sharing knowledge on web development. Before using Hugo, we used [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/12bit) for almost 1 year. Medium did a great job about the marketing, content managing, traffic stats. However, it contains some disadvantages like code syntax highlight, its font is not compatible with Vietnamese. Before 12bit.vn, we have some websites have built with Hugo, therefore we made a wise choice that switching from Medium to Hugo.

**What we love about Hugo:**

- Markdown keeps us happy.
- The rendering process is blazing fast.
- Amazing internal templates like Google Analytics, Open Graph, Twitter Card.
- Theming in Hugo is an exciting job.
- Retrieve GitHub information with ease.
- People can contribute to the content without having an account.

As a developer and an author, I love Hugo. It helps me focus on writing without worrying about securities, database, hosting.

Thank you to all the Hugo contributors that make Hugo is awesome.
